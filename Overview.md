# iCal Import Export #

## When you can use iCal Import/Export ##
  * iCal file stored on a web server (ftp and http with authentication)
  * iCal file stored on sd card


## Current functions ##
  * You can import this file
  * You can check for duplicates
  * Remove a selected iCal file from your calendar (remove all events)
  * You can select the calendar you want to use for importing
  * You can save your calendar as iCal

## Current restrictions ##
  * Some people suffer under timezone issuses, which I can't reproduce. (I also don't like timezone calculations)
  * Only support for VEvents of the iCal standard
  * All day events are not marked as allday they start at 00 and end at 24

## Feature requests ##
For feature requests please use the wiki site "Feature requests" and post comments, I will list them here:
  * Push functionality to store Calendar on web server
  * Automatic synchronization (import/export)
  * Https support
  * Allow untrusted certificates (iCal file could not be parsed. No trusted server certificate)
